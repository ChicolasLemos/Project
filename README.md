Somethings were changed because there is somethings missing on the image. Also some commands are diferent because these were programmed "physically"

What is missing/changed:
1. There is another interface f0/11 on SW3 and SW4 (so you can do a channel-group).
2. Some interfaces are changed because in physically they are different.
3. The spanning-tree or the priority of the vlans are different (you can change them for your desire).
4. The routers EIGRP/OSPF, doens't matter what you choose (in my case I choose EIGRP for the 3 routers).
