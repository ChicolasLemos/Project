# Project
Somethings were changed because there is somethings missing on the image. Also some commands are diferent because these were programmed "physically"
What is missing:
1. On SW3 and SW4 - interface f0/11 (so you can do a channel-group).
2. Some interfaces are changed because in physically they are different.
3. The spanning-tree or the priority of the vlans are different (you can change them for your desire).
